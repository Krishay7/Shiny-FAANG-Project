This is an interactive Shiny web application developed in RStudio which allows users to explore historical stock prices of FAANG companies (META, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX, GOOG) over the last 5 years, visualizing historical trends via line charts and simulate future performance using Monte Carlo simulations through the Gemoetric Brownian Motion (GBM) model.

Users can choose key metrics such as the initial investment value, the investment horizon (time period), the number of simulations and run the model to view future stock projections of FAANG companies. The simulated outcomes are displayed presented in the form of a histogram, enhanced with key statistics such as the median, 10th percentile, and 90th percentile, offering a clear picture of potential risks and returns.
